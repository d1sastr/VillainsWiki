        <header class='info-header'>About Alison</header>
        <p>A young, graceful member of the Crown. When between her duties, she works as a dancer in a prestigious ballet troupe. Her dance dazzles everyone while she masks the pain. If only life was as beautiful as her dance...</p>
        <h5 id='appearance-alison'>Appearance</h5>
        <p>Alison is a young woman with green eyes and black hair that is often tied back in a bun. She has a mole on the right side of her nose.</p>
        <h5 id='personality-alison'>Personality</h5>
        <p>Alison is cautious, reserved, and perhaps a bit secretive. She seems to have an underlying hesitation or mistrust towards others, likely as a result of her past experiences. Despite this, she is able to interact with people in a generally amicable manner, suggesting that she has learned how to adapt and present a sociable facade. Those who are persistent enough to get to know her better may discover that she can be quite enjoyable and engaging to interact with, suggesting a brighter and more open-minded side beneath her exterior caution.</p>

        <header class='info-header'>Her Curse</header>
        <p>When in contact with a person, she can active her curse and make them feel the exhaustion of her never ending dance. Depending on her emotions (ie. intensity of her pain), the amount of exhaustion could vary. Less emotional pain will most likely result in feeling as if the person dance for one full day. Extreme emotional pain, as if they danced for twelve days straight and heavy blisters on the ankles will appear. </p>

        <header class='info-header'>History</header>
        <p>Alison was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. A life of luxury and etiquette lessons. As a young child, she was expected to have a lady skill that would set her apart from other noblewoman. Quickly, she fell in love with dancing. The hobby quickly became a headache for her father since all she wanted to do was dance. It became a forbidden activity in the Jeanfreau household. She would be punished as a child for dancing in the late hours. 
          
After her debut as a woman to society, she was courted by Duncan Belvoir as part of a business arrangement. Courting lasted for a couple of month. Towards the end of her courting, she had already moved to Britain where she would end up engaged. The engagement would last a few months as the wedding preparations began. The couple held a rocky relationship behind closed doors but pose as the perfect couple to society. The marriage would last for a few years until the unfortunate death of her husband.</p>
